    <h1>The iframe element</h1>
    <p><em>A floating frame (also called an inline frame)</em> is a frame placed within the flow of an HTML document, like this:<br><br>
    <IFRAME SRC="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(World_Wide_Web)" WIDTH=500px 
        HEIGHT=50% ALIGN=left HSPACE=12></IFRAME>
        
        Floating frames are much easier to code than a regular frameset document, since they work much like an IMG tag. They can give easy access to the contents of another web site, without interfering with the flow of text.
