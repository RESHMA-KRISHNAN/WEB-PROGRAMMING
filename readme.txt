How about the git workflow?

git init -> initiates the git repo.

1. Local to remote repo:
   
   a. git add file_name -> Adds my file from working tree to staging area.
   b. git commit -> saves my new commit.
   c. git push -> pushes my file from local repo to remote repo.
2. Remote repo to local repo:

   a. git pull -> pulls the changes made in remote repo to my local repo.
